# Factorio blueprints

This repo contains a copy of my mostly used Factorio blueprint books.

## Books

* cybersyn-train-stations.txt - My blueprints for cybersyn train stations that
  I've used in my Pyanodon playthrough. They require Pyanodon loading cranes and
  loaders modernized.
* deconstruction-planners.txt - Various deconstruction planners.
* k2.txt - Blueprints from my K2 playthrough.
* rails.txt - Misc city block rail blueprints.
* space-age.txt - Space-age specific blueprints.
* train-sets.txt - Blueprints for specific train sets, including fuel. When
  placed, they will automatically go to a station called "Depot".
* vanilla.txt - Blueprints for vanilla playthroughs.
